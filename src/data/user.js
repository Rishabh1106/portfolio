			"Hi, I’m Rishabh Nagar, a backend engineer specializing in building scalable, secure, and cloud-native systems. I have strong experience in developing production-grade APIs, automation tools, and infrastructure that powers millions of daily API calls. I currently work at HyperVerge Inc., where I’ve led the development of AI-powered services for identity verification and fraud detection, including a high-availability API ecosystem and a quality-check platform built from scratch. I’ve engineered plug-and-play deployments, implemented Docker-based CKYC systems, and built Slack and Cloudwatch automation tools to improve operations.",
		description2:
			"Skilled in Node.js, FastAPI, AWS, Docker, and Terraform, I’m comfortable owning services end-to-end — from design and development to deployment and monitoring. I follow industry best practices to write clean, maintainable, and reliable code. I graduated from IIIT Naya Raipur with a 9.12 CGPA and received a merit scholarship for academic excellence. I’ve also built projects like a rental app (Rentzzy) and contributed to deep learning research on COVID-19 diagnosis, published in a reputed journal. I’m passionate about solving complex problems, working on impactful products, and continuously improving my technical skills.",
